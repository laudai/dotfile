If u wanna to get the now config.
U can type  
$tmux show -g >> current.tmux.conf
#U need at least a tmux


if u fire up a tmux , u can use like this 
$tmux new-session -s servers -d "ssh login@server"
but if u in this tmux session and exit , it will shutdown this session.
bcz it si fire up from your program and this is the side effect.
